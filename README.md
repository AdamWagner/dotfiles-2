### What's happening here?

Are you a unconditional of _git_, _vim_, _tmux_ or _zsh_? I am one too! Here you can find my dotfiles for these programs, feel free to use them :)

> Above a zsh prompt showing background processes, last execution return code, current path, current git branch and git repository status.

## Installation

Simply clone the project and run `make && make install`.

    git clone https://github.com/abeaumet/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    make && make install

Don't worry about your previous configuration files, they are automatically backed up!

## Uninstallation

Simply type `make uninstall` to get your old configuration files back.
