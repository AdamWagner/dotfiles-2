Here you'll find my configuration files for:
  - git;
  - mercurial;
  - tmux;
  - vim;
  - zsh;
and also the Anonymous Pro font.

There are three scripts in this repository:
  - install.sh: install the new configuration files (backup the previous);
  - update.sh: update the configuration files (including the submodules);
  - clean.sh: restore your previous configuration files (erase the currently used).

Enjoy!
