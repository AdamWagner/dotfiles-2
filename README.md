Here you'll find my configuration files for:
  - git
  - mercurial
  - tmux
  - vim
  - zsh

And also the Anonymous Pro font.

There are two scripts at the root:
  - install.sh: install the new configuration files (backup the previous)
  - clean.sh: restore your previous configuration files (erase the current)

Enjoy!
